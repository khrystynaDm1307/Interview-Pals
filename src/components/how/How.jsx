        <h3>
          Here at interview pals, we provide you with a platform that links you
          to a global network of industry professionals with hiring experience
          from all sectors, seniority levels and backgrounds. We enable you to
          set up a practice (mock interview) in a relaxed environment, but
          simulating real interview conditions and questions, unique to the
          roles you are applying for. This has the positive effect of reducing
          anxiety as you familiarise yourself with the process, content and
          context. We then give you access to the interviewerâ€™s feedback which
          you can use to adjust everything, from body language, to your answers
          and your preparation.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          The outcome of this is to boost your confidence, eliminate stress and
          prepare your mindset for the real interview, maximising your chances
          of getting that next dream job!
