            obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign
            in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information
            of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must
            immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or

            or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a
            result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete
            your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have
            violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or
            content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we
            delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not

            “Content”) that you submit on the Services in the course of using
            the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy,
            quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and
            intellectual property ownership or right to use of all submitted
            Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review the

            discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
            opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or
            objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce,
            adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or
            stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar

            products at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order
            you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
            quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These
            restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer
            account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same
            billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change
            to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting
            the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time
